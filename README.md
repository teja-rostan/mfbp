The code represents Matrix Factorization-based Brain Pruning (MFBP), a method for pruning neural networks. The algorithm for this learning model and its results are described in article --link--. Our motivation was to reduce neural network size and time complexity while maintaining its generalization performance.

Prerequisites for MFBP are described in requirements.txt. The algorithm uses Theano library. The instruction for installation of Theano library, which we followed is available at http://www.johnwittenauer.net/configuring-theano-for-high-performance-deep-learning/.
